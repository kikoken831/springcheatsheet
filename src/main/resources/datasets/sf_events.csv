41248_rpd,SF Rec Park,Mixed Media: Abstract and Figure-Hybrid Art,"This    class emphasizes the power of inner vision—creating images from within,    rather than simply copying nature. While we will begin by studying and    imitating existing forms, the focus will shift toward transforming those    observations into original, expressive creations. The main goal of this    course is for students to discover their own unique visual style. By    exploring Surrealist, Cubist, and imitating ancient artistic influences,    students will experience the joy of creative transformation within oneself.      Students will first learn the principles of abstract geometric composition,    then move toward combining figurative or organic elements with abstraction.    The aim is to develop an individual artistic “flavor”—a step toward personal    originality.      Hands-on support will be provided throughout. No prior experience is    necessary.

In this hands-on class, instructor Sophie Wertz will guide you through the    process of designing and creating your own unique sets of earrings. Polymer    clay has become a favorite medium among DIY jewelry makers — it’s    lightweight, vibrant, and incredibly versatile. Once you learn a few key    sculpting techniques, the design possibilities are endless! You’ll start by    getting familiar with polymer clay through short lessons on color mixing,    clay conditioning, and handling techniques. Sophie will demonstrate popular    methods like marbling, sculpting miniature florals, and using carving and    modeling tools. You’ll have access to a variety of cutters, rollers, and    texture tools to shape and personalize your designs. From there, you’ll learn    how to prepare clay sheets, bake your creations, assemble, and finish your    earrings. By the end of class, you’ll go home with a custom jewelry piece and    leave with confidence, skills, and know-how to keep creating polymer clay    jewelry on your own!

The aim is to develop an individual artistic “flavor”—a step toward personal    originality.      Hands-on support will be provided throughout. No prior experience is    necessary.
